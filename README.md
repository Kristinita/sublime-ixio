sublime-ixio
============

Quick Sublime Text 3 plugin to post to ix.io. Definitely a work in progress.

Usage: 

1. Edit ixio.sublime-settings with your ixio details. If you don't have ixio details just make something up. It really doesn't matter. 

2. Select text to post to ix.io or just have a file open

3. Press Shift+Ctrl+P (Shift+Cmd+P in osx) to open the command pallete

4. Type 'ixio' and select ixio: post

5. Press enter.

6. The link to your paste will be copied to your clipboard.

7. If you'd like to see a list of your pastes open the command pallete and type 'ixio' then select ixio: post.

8. To open a post from the list put the cursor on the first line of the paste and then right click.
